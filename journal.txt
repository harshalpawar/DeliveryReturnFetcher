New problems
r.jina.ai/hm.com finds Free shipping above ₹1999
but it's not in my scraped data
The links themselves are bad - this means jina search is bad! I need to try with brave.

For nike - jina finds ₹ 1 250.00 for all orders but gemini doesn't
This is a known issue. I need to prompt better and write clean.py

Scraped data have to go in a different data file because they fuck up my logs
It's 100% jina search issue, basically the keywords that work for hm don't work for nike and vice versa
I checked and brave works well for both nike and hm

Another problem is that nike declares a different delivery time on their policy page and product pages so this will have to be handled by the prompt. Just return the standard response.

The prompt will also need to handle memberships. Ignore delivery and return info under memberships.

TODO-
[x] Check all files once
Switch to Brave Search (Critical for search accuracy).
Separate Scraped Data (Quick fix to clean up logs and I need them for clean.py).
[x] Optimize Gemini Prompt and config (Improves extraction accuracy).
    Also check out structured output and any other useful options in their docs
[x] Optimize Jina config
Include Home Page and Product Page (Some brands have the info here).
Write clean.py (split scraped data into chunks and rank them by relevance)
Do the 20 brand test (test on a diverse dataset)
Run the Pipeline for 5 Brands (Deliver something tangible).

Pages have a lot of noise and sites keep thinking I'm from the US

Clean up the code
Write documentation
