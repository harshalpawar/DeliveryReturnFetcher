The format was understood and kept in mind throughout the process.\n\n**Step 2: Extract Delivery Charges:**  Information was found on both the shipping policy page and product pages. Combining the information from the refund policy and product pages, it was determined that there's a Rs. 49 charge for orders below Rs. 999, and free shipping for orders above Rs. 999.\n\n**Step 3: Extract and Calculate Estimated Delivery Time:** Conflicting information was found between the policy page (7-10 business days) and product pages (2-5 working days). Prioritizing the policy page as instructed, \"7-10 business days\" was used.\n\n**Step 4: Extract Return Period and Conditions:** The refund policy and product pages clearly stated a \"15 days returns & exchange policy\".  It was noted that both returns and exchanges are mentioned, so it's not exchange-only.\n\n**Step 5: Determine Return Method(s):** While not explicitly stated as \"Brand pickup\", the presence of a \"Return & Exchange\" portal and the general practice of fashion brands in India suggest brand pickup as the likely return method.  No pickup charges were mentioned.\n\n**Step 6: Determine Refund Mode:** The refund policy clearly states refunds can be issued as \"Urbano Credits\" or credited back to the \"original mode of payment\", with COD orders refunded via \"UPI\".\n\n**Step 7: Collate Additional Information:**  Relevant details like dispatch time (1-2 days), more granular delivery time estimates (2-3 days for metros, 3-5 for rest of India from product pages), and the shipping charge for orders below Rs. 999 (from refund policy) were collated.\n\n**Step 8: Assemble the Final Response:** All extracted information was assembled into the JSON format as requested, ensuring all steps were followed and irrelevant information was excluded. The final output is clear, concise, and adheres to the specified structure.",
