Delivery charges - Search didn't find https://deepikaarora.com/policies/shipping-policy
Fuck this page is not even indexed on Brave and Google. This is an odd case - I'll come back to this.
Delivery time - FAQs page say 7-10 days. But the accurate information is on ^that page which Search didn't find.
I HAVE to crawl the home page for policy page links.

Volcape - 
Gemini fucking hallucinated store credits LMAO.

New prompt additions - 
If return is exchange only, say exchange only. If exchange is size only, say exchange(size only). If exchange is defects only, say exchange(defect only).
If return is exchange only, then no need to mention refund.
For return method, the only options are brand pickup, self shipping and return in store (define them).

Ignore international delivery times. Only add up domestic delivery times.
Add up the dispatch and delivery times.
Delivery/Return times must always be mentioned in days, not hours.
