Your purpose is to extract and format the delivery and return policy of a fashion brand in India based on the provided text. Follow these steps meticulously:

**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Format**
- Your final output must strictly adhere to the following structure:
  **Delivery:**
  - Delivery Charges: Rs. X; Free over Rs. Y (or "Free shipping")
  - Estimated Delivery Time: Within B days OR A-B days
  **Returns:**
  - Return Period: Within X days (or "X days - exchanges only", "X days - exchanges only (size only)", "X days - exchanges only (defect only)")
  - Return Method: Brand pickup / Self-ship / Return in store (mention return pickup charges if any)
  - Refund Mode: Bank a/c / Store credit / Original mode of payment / Other (Omit if exchange only)
  **Additional Info:**
  - [Relevant details not fitting above]
- You must ignore information related to international shipping, memberships, loyalty programs, or subscription services.

**Step 2: Extract Delivery Charges**
- Find the standard delivery charge. Format as "Rs. X".
- Find the minimum order value for free shipping. Format as "; Free over Rs. Y".
- If shipping is always free, state "Free shipping".
- Combine these into the "Delivery Charges:" line.

**Step 3: Extract and Calculate Estimated Delivery Time**
- Locate the estimated delivery times for domestic orders within India.
- **Prioritize information from the main policy page** over product page examples if conflicts exist.
- If different times are given for different regions (e.g., metros vs. rest of India), find the minimum and maximum values across all domestic regions to create a single range (e.g., 3-5 days and 5-7 days becomes "3-7 days"). Note the regional differences in Step 7 (Additional Info).
- If dispatch time and delivery time are mentioned separately, add them together to get the total estimated delivery time.
- Ensure the final time is expressed in **days** (convert hours if necessary, e.g., 48 hours = 2 days).
- Format as "Within B days" or "A-B days".

**Step 4: Extract Return Period and Conditions**
- Find the number of days within which a customer can initiate a return or exchange.
- Check if returns are only for exchange.
  - If yes, check if it's size-only exchange or defect-only exchange.
  - Format accordingly: "X days - exchanges only", "X days - exchanges only (size only)", or "X days - exchanges only (defect only)".
- If regular returns are allowed, format as "Within X days".

**Step 5: Determine Return Method(s)**
- Identify how the customer returns the item:
  - If the brand arranges pickup (e.g., "scheduled courier", "reverse logistics"), classify as **"Brand pickup"**. Note any associated pickup charges (e.g., "Brand pickup (Rs. 50 pickup charge)").
  - If the customer must ship it back themselves, classify as **"Self-ship"**.
  - If the customer can return it to a physical store, classify as **"Return in store"**.
- List all applicable methods found.

**Step 6: Determine Refund Mode**
- **If Step 4 indicated "exchanges only", skip this step and omit the "Refund Mode" line in the final output.**
- Otherwise, identify how the refund is processed:
  - To a bank account: "Bank a/c"
  - As store credit: "Store credit"
  - To the original payment method: "Original mode of payment"
  - Other specified modes: Describe briefly (e.g., "Wallet transfer")
- Format as "Refund Mode: [Result]".

**Step 7: Collate Additional Information**
- Review the source text again.
- Identify any other relevant delivery or return details that were not captured in the structured fields above (e.g., specific conditions for returns like "only for defective items", delivery restrictions like "only in select cities", regional delivery time differences noted in Step 3).
- **Crucially, do NOT include:**
  - Information already captured in the structured fields.
  - Details about memberships, loyalty programs, international shipping.
  - Conflicting delivery times that were discarded in Step 3.
  - General marketing text or irrelevant details.
- List these points under "Additional Info:".

**Step 8: Assemble the Final Response**
- Combine the results from Steps 2 through 7 into the final, structured format defined in Step 1.
- Double-check that all rules have been followed and no forbidden information is included.
- Ensure clarity and conciseness.
