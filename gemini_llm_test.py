DID NIKE CHARGE ME AN ADDITIONAL FEE FOR MY NIKE ORDER?

Be aware that some banks may consider your Nike purchase an international purchase and charge a small transaction fee according to their policies. Nike doesn't charge this fee or control when your bank will charge it. We'll only charge you for the order total displayed during checkout.

What can we help you with?
How do I return my Nike order?

You can return unworn and unwashed Nike.com and Nike App orders within 30 days.* Simply follow the steps below to return your order.

And remember, we'll cover the return delivery fees for Nike Members (guest orders will have a return fee subtracted from the refund).

1. Sign in to your Nike Member profile and go to your order history. Select "View or Manage" for the order you're returning, then select "Start Return". If you purchased as a guest, you'll need to access your order using your order number and email address.

2. Choose the items to return, provide the return reason from the drop-down menu and select "Continue".

3. Submit your return and confirm your address—we'll automatically email a printable pre-paid label. You can also choose to download the label.

4. Pack your items for delivery and securely attach your printed return delivery label. Be sure to seal the package and remove or cover any previous delivery labels and barcodes to avoid delivery delays.

5. Hand your return to the agent at the appointed time and location. Unattended returns won't be collected—someone must be present to hand over the return.

Choose a So-You Shoe

Whether you're remixing a classic into something never seen before or
simplifying the latest drop into a totally neutral palette, your customisation
journey starts with choosing a shoe. Luckily, we're always adding
newness so you can find the just-right way to express your style.

Start Customising
How to Nike By You

Spinning through all the curated colour palettes and premium material
options in the Nike By You builder is an experimentation session in 3D.
Not sure where to start? We asked Nike designers for their best tips and
tricks in a series of fun, short videos to help you find that so-you spark.

Explore
What's Your PiD?

Like your shoe signature, your Personal iD is any combo of letters and
numbers that rep you. Maybe it's a nickname, a mantra or your computer
password (wait, probably not a good idea). It can be almost anything! Pick
your PiD, and show the world who this signature shoe belongs to.

What can we help you with?
CONSUMER CARE STORE CLAIM AND EXCHANGE POLICY
CLAIMS

If you think your product has a manufacturing defect, you can submit a product claim for purchases made at Nike stores and authorised Nike retail stores with the following photographs:

A picture of your product and the area you believe to have a manufacturing defect.

The store receipt or invoice clearly showing the purchase date, purchase location, and purchase amount.

The product tag on your footwear or apparel (please ensure the product number is clearly visible). For equipment claims, be sure to include a picture of the attached sticker.

After a claim is submitted, Nike will then inspect the claim to determine if the condition of the claim product is due to a manufacturing defect or not. Nike’s decision in respect of the claim product shall be final and confidential. If Nike is unable to process the claim on the basis of the information or photographs sent, the same will be communicated to the store and consumer through the same claim thread.

Upon receipt of the authorisation email from Nike for replacement of a product, the consumer should present a hard or soft copy of the email to the original place of purchase. The authorised partner will then allow the consumer to choose a product of the same or lesser purchase value of the original purchase as available at that time in the store.

In case of unavailability of the same or similar product there shall be no cash refund, but the consumer will be entitled to choose any other Nike product from the available stock that's equal to or lower than the actual price paid. If the replacement value is lower, the differential amount shall not be refunded. If the replacement value is higher than the purchase value, the consumer shall have to pay the differential of the amount.

Stores, retailers, and consumers must ensure that the replacement process is completed within 30 calendar days from the date of the authorisation email sent by Nike. After 30 calendar days, the consumer will not be eligible for a replacement from Nike.

Claims past six months from the original purchase date will not be accepted. Claims will also be rejected in the following situations:

Any counterfeit or non-genuine Nike products.

EXCHANGE ELIGIBILITY

DOES MY NIKE ORDER NEED TO CLEAR CUSTOMS?

Since your Nike order is dispatched from abroad, local customs regulations require verification of your national ID, passport or delivery information to clear and deliver your order. Bear in mind that the address on your documents must match the delivery address for the order or you'll need to provide proof of address in addition to your documents.

We make clearing your order easy—just enter your Know Your Consumer (KYC) information during checkout.

If you opt not to enter your information during checkout, your order will be temporarily held. You'll have seven days to provide the required information (we'll send you a few email reminders).

If we don't receive your information within seven days, or if we're unable to validate the information you provide, we'll automatically cancel the order.

NIKE BY YOU ORDERS

Providing your KYC information works a little differently for orders that include any Nike By You items. In this case, once the custom shoes are ready to be dispatched, the courier for your order will email a secure link so you can confirm your KYC information within 30 days. After you confirm your information, the courier will clear and deliver your order. If we don't receive your information within 30 days, or if we're unable to validate the information you provide, we won't be able to deliver the order and we'll issue you a refund.

FAQs

What documents do I need to provide to confirm my KYC information?
Indian citizens can use one of the documents below for verification:

Aadhaar card
Voter ID
Passport

When uploading a copy of your documents, remember to submit copies of the front and back. If you're using your passport for verification, ensure that it's still valid, as expired passports are not accepted.

Please be aware that regulations require the address on your documents to match your order's delivery address.

I'm a foreign national living in India—how can I confirm my KYC information?
A passport can be used to confirm your information. Additionally, customs will require proof of your address: a hotel booking receipt, stay visa, rental agreement, or you may provide proof of living with a relative or friend to confirm your address.

What if the address on my documents and the delivery address for the order don't match?
During checkout, select "Address on ID does not match delivery address" and then submit your proof of residence. You'll need to provide a document that matches the delivery address.

What if I didn't submit the correct documents?
In this case, your order will be cancelled and we'll send you an order cancellation email.

For orders with Nike By You items, the courier may get in touch with you for the correct information if it's within 30 days, or your order may be returned to sender. If your order is returned to sender, you won't get an email cancellation, but we'll refund your payment (if payment was collected).
